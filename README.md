# COVID-19 Data Discovery
After taking stock of the COVID-19 dashboards out all of them have baked charts. Fewer allow passing parameters to update these charts. Most of them aren't client-side apps, and some of them rely on third part services to create, update, expand upon, and serve. Some are open source. Some are shoehorned into existing web templates, and others aren't clear on what data is being loaded in to inform the dashboard. These were built with the assumption that the end user would be able to load the whole dashboard easily. So the user has a reliable, fast internet connection. But the spread of COVID-19 is a global phenomenon; It's important to think of spots that might not have the capacity to load these dashboards while providing the discovery capabilties and data granualarity for each user to handle informing themselves based on what they care about. 

With these observations in mind this repo sets out to create a minimalist, accessible, lightweight, global, shop-floor data discovery tool anyone can use on any device (well, from the oldest smartphone to the latest iPad) in every conceivable internet connection that's faster than sending data by carrier pigeon. Those are the tables stakes to answering the real question for internet users anywhere and everywhere -- How much of a threat is COVID-19 to my loved ones? We seek to give them the best answer to that question the data can provide.
