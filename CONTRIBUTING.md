0. It will become an imperative to have a Github account pretty quickly, [so make one](https://github.com/join). I'm not affiliated with Github besides the fact I use their free tier services.
1. Get every device you have that has a browser (typically, your phone, tablet, laptop, and desktop computer), [open our production site](https://coviddata.website), and use it. If you notice anything strange, [open an issue](https://github.com/trycrmr/covid-data-discovery/issues).
2. If you've done that, open an issue with every recommendation you can think of for the site. 
3. If you've done the above, [look at the existing issues](https://github.com/trycrmr/covid-data-discovery/issues) and [add a label to them](https://github.com/trycrmr/covid-data-discovery/labels). If an issue is related/redundant to another issue, link it to the related issue by typing a hashtag/pound sign, then the issue number it's related/redundant to (example: "Related to #19" (While commenting on issue 20)).
4. Now, revisit the issues you've read already and see if you can help with any of them. If you help, subscribe to notifications on the issue as folks respond (if you comment, Github will subscribe you automatically). Helping on an issue is assigning it to yourself, and you're done when it's closed.
5. Then, document how the site works! If documentation doesn't exist yet, open an issue for it and start writing it in the comments. 
6. Last but not least, share [COVID Data Website](https://coviddata.website)!

## Install / Code contributions
1. Fork the repo (click the button in the top right your Github interface)
2. Clone the repo (SSH: `git clone git@github.com:trycrmr/covid-data-discovery.git` or HTTPS: `git clone https://github.com/trycrmr/covid-data-discovery.git`)
3. Add git@github.com:trycrmr/covid-data-discovery.git as an upstream repo (`git remote add upstream https://github.com/trycrmr/covid-data-discovery.git`)
4. `npm run dev`
5. Create a new branch named on your forked repo with the following convention: "[issue-number][1-3 words summarizing the issue]" (Example: "19-new-covid-vaccine"). If an issue doesn't exist, open one, reference it, and start working on it. 
6. Open all PRs into master of the upstream repo. Must maintain feature & performance parity. No PRs that vary from the branch naming convention or have merge conflicts with master will be accepted as well.
7. Your PR will be reviewed shortly. In the meantime, repeat steps #5 & #6! 

## Remember
COVID-19 impacts everyone, everywhere. The internet can't reach everyone, everywhere, but those it can reach are definitely going to be able to use this site.
