## Install & contribute
1) Fork the repo
2) Clone the repo
3) Add git@github.com:trycrmr/covid-data-discovery.git as an upstream repo
4) Perform steps #1-3 repo git@github.com:trycrmr/Coronavirus-Dashboard.git. Code works with Nodejs 13.x.x (open an issue if it doesn't).
5) Switch to the api branch and `npm run dev`. Api defaults to localhost:3000.
6) Open covid-data-discovery index.html in your browser of choice. It should look very similar to the live site with no errors in the console (well, maybe that chrome favicon request uninitiated by the codebase).
7) Create a new branch named with the following convention: "[issue-number][1-3 words summarizing the issue]" (Example: "19-new-covid-vaccine"). If an issue doesn't exist, open one, reference it, and start working on it. 
8) Open all PRs into master of the upstream repo. Must maintain feature & performance parity and no PRs with merge conflicts will be accepted.
9) Ta da! You've done it! Congrats on your open source contribution! Feel fulfilled. Repeat steps #7-8 at your leisure.
